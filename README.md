# Welcome to the Bergen Cloud User Group!

Our goal is to provide free cloud education and meetups to members who may have little or no experience working with cloud computing before.
Starting out, we're focusing on Amazon Web Services (AWS), but we plan on expanding to Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure in the future as well.
